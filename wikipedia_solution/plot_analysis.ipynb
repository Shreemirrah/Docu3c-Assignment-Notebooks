doubts that the dead woman is Rama : Several such necklaces are available Devi now gets another vision of another woman getting murdered Devi also pinpoints two details : a magazine named Priya with a

sought financial help from Ram relatives  they spurned Ram requests  leaving Ram helplessly alone Consequently  Ram took to illegal ways of earning money Ram ran into Jagmohan and Parvati Later  the

South is led by Hanuman and includes Vali 's son Angada  who allies Vali with Sugriva  and an elderly bear  Jambavan The three  along with a senior vanara soldier  enter a cliff in search of water and come out the other side  facing the ocean There  meet Sampati  brother of the slain Jatayu After being informed of Vali brother 's sad demise  the upset and angered bird informs the vanara leaders that Ravana indeed flew over the land they were on now and that Vali could be found  along with Sita  in the Island of Lanka Jambavan then tells Hanuman that when Vali was younger  Vali was put under a spell which kept Vali powers in check  but that now Vali would be released from the spell in order to fly to Lanka and find Sita Hanuman then flies across the sea and withstands a stern challenge from a dangerous sea monster by killing Vali and tearing Vali to pieces Among one of Hanuman 's many powers is Hanuman ability to change shape at will  and Hanuman is able to fly across Lanka without being seen Hanuman sees Ravana walking to a forest where Sita is with her caretaker  and after the King joins the subjects and her caretaker leaves her alone  Sita then bursts into tears  pining for her husband  little knowing that Hanuman is watching her Hanuman jumps down from a tree and introduces Hanuman as Rama 's friend  offering also to take her back Sita magnanimously refuses  saying that there are many people in Lanka who have been captured and enslaved  and that they need to be freed as well Hanuman assures her that Rama will defeat Ravana and release the people  while urging her to be patient till then After having some fun attacking the Royal guards  Hanuman allows Hanuman to be captured by the fire-breathing Kumbha  son of Kumbhakarna The vanara messenger meets Ravana face to face and warns the Lanka ruler of Hanuman folly in capturing Sita while instructing Hanuman to return her to Prince Rama and seek Hanuman forgiveness Ravana threatens to kill Hanuman  but after being dissuaded by Hanuman brother Vibhishana  decides instead to set fire to the vanara 's tail and let Hanuman go home While grimacing in pain from the fire  Hanuman inadvertently sets fire to a few stalls and buildings in the city before flying away Vibhishana later pleads with Ravana to release Sita out of fear of impending disaster for Lanka  but Ravana angrily rebuffs Hanuman and exiles Hanuman from the Kingdom Meanwhile  Rama  Lakshmana  Sugriva and the vanara Kingdom 's subjects are all gathered along the south coast  discussing how to travel to Lanka is then that Vibhishana appears and offers to join Rama 's forces Rama is convinced of Vibhishana 's sincerity by Hanuman and agrees to accept Vibhishana  who in turn advises Rama to pray to the Sea God for a solution to cross over to Lanka For seven days and seven nights Rama observes prayers  and on the eighth dawn the Sea God reveals Rama and instructs Rama to build a bridge with stones that have Rama name inscribed The stones would be supported by the ocean and all living beings could walk across safely The members of Rama 's army then set about building the bridge  after which they proceed to Lanka where they will set up base camp not far from the capital city In Ravana 's Palace  the King and council members discuss the threat of war Prahastha  the Chief Minister  assures Ravana that the threat is futile and that Rama 's army would be finished off While an elderly member  presumably Ravana 's father  is against the war and even Prahastha advises the King to return Sita  the other members appear wholeheartedly in support of the war  including Ravana 's son Indrajit From base camp in Lanka  Rama then asks Angada to convey a message of peace to Ravana  namely that if Rama was to release Sita and the other prisoners who would in turn take refuge under Rama  there would be no need of war and the subsequent bloodshed But when Angada carries this message to Ravana at the Palace  Rama is rebuffed and even attacked by the Royal Guards Ravana gives a clear sign that Rama wants war  and after Angada relays this message to Rama later that evening  the Prince of Ayodhya then addresses the army  asking them if they would fight for ` Justice and Rama '  to which they emphatically say yes \",\n",

perceive Western culture and values to be so desirable  they cook up a plan to impress Kishorilal with an English song Unimpressed  Kishorilal sings back a hymn-like song in a more traditional Indian style  `` Kishorilal love Kishorilal India Ganga joins in this song  expressing Ganga equal love for India The song emphasises the movie 's theme in key moments Kishorilal asks Suraj to promise Ganga as a bride for Ganga westernised son  Rajiv Ganga is convinced that Ganga will be not only a perfect bride  but the way treasured Indian values are revived and passed on in Ganga Americanized family and large circle of Indian friends and business acquaintances Suraj 's family accepts the proposal Kishorilal knows Kishorilal will have a tough time trying to convince Kishorilal son to marry or even

interviewed as the composer of the new musical hit `` Kishorilal Love Kishorilal India However  when Kishorilal calls to ask for Kishorilal help  Kishorilal loyalty to Kishorilal uncle is so strong that Kishorilal cuts the interview short Arjun flies to India ahead of Rajiv to set the stage for Arjun to meet Ganga  unintentionally offending Ganga 's family with a barrage of orders that includes removing farm animals from sight and relocating servant When `` Ganga  is first introduced  she is hideously made up  with horn-rimmed glasses and buck teeth  sending Arjun into a panic about the success of Kishorilal 's plans Later  when the meets the authentic Ganga  the is entranced  and in an effort to make up for the offensive behaviour  promises to be a trustworthy friend Immediately after shake hands  Ganga moves the farm animals and the servant back into the enclosed yard She explains to Arjun that her family loves all who are a part of  even animals and servants  in contrast to Arjun 's apparent and somewhat Western view that are not very important When Rajiv arrives  Rajiv also acts offensively  sometimes intentionally  and sometimes because Rajiv has no idea of what Indians consider rude or inappropriate But Arjun  despite Arjun own attraction to Ganga  smooths the way out of loyalty to Rajiv and Kishorilal In Rajiv determination to help the marriage come to pass  Arjun deceives Ganga about Rajiv 's character and habits  Ganga assures her that Rajiv is a `` nice guy   Ganga also covers up for Rajiv  telling Ganga the cigarettes she found in Rajiv 's room are Rajiv own Rajiv and Ganga agree to the wedding The engagement is set in India  but the families agree that Ganga should come to America before the wedding Ganga arrives in America  and is hurt to hear her traditional dress and `` foreign  manners despised by Rajiv 's snaky mother at a party in her new home However  at a very large and influential gathering arranged by Kishorilal  she is invited to sing She sings `` I love my India  and receives warm  sincere applause In her new surroundings  her only friend and confidant is Arjun  with whom she begins to form a special bond Little by little Ganga realises that Rajiv is n't the person Arjun portrayed Rajiv to be Rajiv not only seems eager to leave her at home whenever possible  with little explanation or apology  when Rajiv does bring her out with Rajiv friends  Rajiv smokes  gets drunk and acts like a bully At one party  Rajiv is drinking and flirting with other women while a Western man begins dancing too closely with Ganga  though Rajiv ignores the situation  Arjun loses Arjun temper and fights the man to the ground Later  Ganga is shocked to discover pictures of Rajiv with Rajiv girlfriend that clearly show Rajiv has had a sexual relationship with her She is also astonished to find that Kishorilal 's family treats Arjun  a near relative and loyal friend  as a servant  contemptuously dismissing the idea of Rajiv joining them for dinner or even eating in the same house When Rajiv abandons Ganga for dinner with Rajiv girlfriend  who Rajiv is still seeing  Ganga confronts Arjun Arjun justifies Rajiv 's behaviour  reminding Ganga that Rajiv lives like an American  and that she should not make a fuss about such a petty affair This exchange leads to a key monologue from Ganga Infuriated that Arjun sees Rajiv 's casual  unapologetic unfaithfulness as a `` petty affair   she tells Rajiv that she demands love -- the kind of love Rajiv gives others Rejecting `` love  that is less  she further rejects being made into a decoration to fit into Kishorilal 's palatial mansion Arjun realises that Ganga has fallen in love with Ganga  but because of Ganga immense loyalty to Kishorilal  Ganga continues to encourage her to stay with the engagement and worry about `` changing  Rajiv later On the next day  Arjun 's birthday  Arjun is depressed and wants to be alone However  Ganga finds out and asks Rajiv to go with her to wish Arjun a happy birthday Rajiv rudely refuses  making clear Arjun also views Arjun as some kind of servant Ganga visits the garage without Rajiv  joining a surprise party thrown by Arjun 's band mates Inevitably  Rajiv 's hostile aunt Neeta notices the growing friendship between Ganga and Arjun and warns Kishorilal Rajiv arranges for Arjun to leave the city immediately  telling Rajiv Rajiv has been promoted  and must start with a board meeting the following morning in another city Kishorilal then informs Rajiv  who is on Kishorilal way to another party in Las Vegas  that Kishorilal must take Ganga with Ganga In Las Vegas  Rajiv gets drunk and reveals Rajiv true contempt and hatred for India  Rajiv derides Indians as `` hypocrites   and `` stupid Ganga heatedly responds that Indians hate America 's drug-riddled  amoral alternative Furious  Ganga tries to rape Ganga  after a violent struggle  she knocks Ganga unconscious and flees Kishorilal starts making calls to try to track the missing Ganga down  but Arjun goes looking for her and finds her crying at a train station with her clothes torn Arjun tries to persuade her to go back to Kishorilal 's home  but she refuses Arjun promises to protect her and help her get back to her family in India Just after arrive at her home in India  Kishorilal calls Ganga 's father Suraj Believing Arjun eloped with Arjun daughter  Suraj tries to kill Suraj with a family sword that hangs on the wall Arjun seizes the sword and swears to Ganga 's faithfulness and chastity Then Arjun leaves  intending never to return Meanwhile  Suraj locks Ganga in a shed  breathing threats of murder Ganga 's siblings and grandmother sneak in and advise Ganga to run away with Arjun Ganga realises that Ganga is in love with Arjun  and with help  secretly leaves the home By this time  Kishorilal has arrived in India with Rajiv Ganga catches up with Arjun at a temple  and demands Arjun confess Arjun love Still loyal to Kishorilal  Arjun refuses  insisting that Arjun does not love Arjun Ganga is devastated  but before Ganga walks away  Rajiv turns up with several thugs to kill Arjun but Ganga protects Arjun Arjun 's then confronted by Rajiv for this In the ensuing fight  Arjun takes a terrible beating before getting the upper hand Kishorilal arrives with Suraj just as Arjun is about to kill Rajiv Kishorilal furiously suggests that Arjun `` honorably  kill Arjun with a conveniently handy gun  and demands Arjun `` tell the truth  about how Arjun came to be in India with Rajiv 's promised bride This leads to the second key monologue of the film Arjun confronts Kishorilal with not wanting to know the truth  people who want the truth  do n't ask for it with a gun Kishorilal accuses Kishorilal of having become a true Westerner after all  since Kishorilal wealth has eviscerated Kishorilal compassion and ability to examine the truth when it does n't match what Kishorilal wants it to be Confessing that love does  in truth  love Ganga  love affirms that love never pursued love and has acted honourably  while Rajiv in every way rejected honourable action and lied about how Ganga came to have returned so suddenly to India  not only was Ganga  unable to merge with Western culture  Western values almost utterly ruined Ganga Ganga confirms Rajiv 's attempted rape  which shocks everyone  then tells Ganga father Ganga is willing to die by whatever means Ganga chooses  poison  fire  or hunger This pivotal scene both verbalises and symbolises how good  happy  pure Ganga  instead of being able to uplift and enrich Rajiv  has been sacrificed to the unsuccessful attempt to merge India with the West Ironically  India also highlights one way in which Western culture can be viewed as more just and compassionate than Indian culture  since a Western bride can break off an unsuitable engagement without risking death at the hands of outraged family members Moreover  but realising pure has indeed heard the truth  Kishorilal affirms that Ganga will marry Ganga son Rejecting Rajiv  Ganga embraces Arjun as Arjun true son  and along with raj and Arjun family blesses the engagement between Arjun and Ganga \",\n",

important as chasteness of the body Thakur decides to delay the matter for the time being Gajendra is aghast at this  and makes a plan to abduct Jyoti  so that afterwards Gajendra will have no choice

the local community by terrorising people and stealing money from innocent merchants Other than Jaidev boxing practice  Siddhu leads a relatively aimless and wanderlust life In Siddhu spare time  Siddhu hangs out with friends  occasionally stealing money from rich people Siddhu is financially dependent on Siddhu elder brother Jai  who lives in Raunak Singh 's house but occasionally visits Siddhu and tops up Siddhu finances The opening scene features a female lawyer Fatima Madam defending Siddhu in court against accusations of small-time theft The lawyer tries to convince the judge to show leniency towards Siddhu on account of Siddhu disadvantaged background as an orphan The judge points out that Siddhu has already been shown leniency four times  and is greeted with laughter by everybody  including Siddhu In the commotion  Siddhu steals Rs 400 from Siddhu own lawyer 's purse Siddhu is let free Later  when Siddhu asks the lawyer what Siddhu fees are  Siddhu asks Siddhu for a fees of Rs 400  and Siddhu is thus forced to part with the money Siddhu has just stolen The lawyer gives no indication of awareness that Siddhu had stolen an equal amount of money Later  Siddhu  while joking around with friends  gets angry when one of Siddhu friends suggests that the lawyer may be receiving sexual favours from Siddhu in exchange for defending Siddhu in court A few days later  Raunak Singh hires Siddhu to deliver a letter to a local cricket player  and to beat up the player if Siddhu shows signs of resisting Unknown to Siddhu  the letter contains instructions to the player to get out after scoring a certain number of runs  so that Ronnie can win a bet Siddhu delivers the letter and intimidates the cricket player into agreeing to follow the instructions  breaking the player 's bat in the process Later  while returning  Siddhu gets into a motorcycle speed race with a motorcycle gang led by Charlie  which escalates into a dare game to run towards a moving train at night Siddhu beats Charlie 's past record in the game Charlie chooses to run again  but falls on the train tracks  and seems to be headed for death as the train approaches Siddhu Siddhu rescues Charlie at considerable personal risk In the process  Siddhu becomes friends with Alisha  also part of the gang  and friendship blossoms into love The famous song Aati Kya Khandala is situated during this period  when Siddhu is trying to cheer Alisha up after a fight with Alisha father is revealed that Siddhu saw Siddhu own father 's death when Siddhu was a child which mentally affected Siddhu throughout Siddhu life Siddhu father 's words -- `` anybody can swim with the tide  but the truly brave person is Siddhu who swims against the tide  -- remained with Siddhu  though Siddhu had only been with Siddhu father for a little while Back in Siddhu local community  Siddhu witnesses an incident of some of Ronnie 's men beating up a local restaurateur for not paying extortion money to Ronnie 's gang The restaurateur runs for his life as Ronnie 's men chase him  but none of the other community people come to his aid Harihar Mafatlal  a social worker  coaxes a police constable to stop the fight The restaurateur and his two assailants land up on the roof where Siddhu is doing boxing practice  with Hari and the constable following The constable breaks up the fight and scolds the restaurateur  and Hari is angry at the constable for blaming the victim The assailants leave  greeting Siddhu on the way out Siddhu offers some water to the restaurateur and introduces Siddhu to Hari  suggesting to both to avoid getting on the wrong side of Ronnie Hari speaks of principle and self-respect  and Siddhu is reminded of things that Siddhu father told Siddhu long ago Ronnie is furious to hear about this  and wishes to kill the restaurateur and Hari immediately Ronnie explains the logic of terror to Ronnie henchmen : if even a few people stop acceding to Ronnie demands  then that will instill rebelliousness against Ronnie 's demands in others Fear is essential for the kind of respect Ronnie enjoys  and being lenient against a few people who stand up to Ronnie based on a short-term cost -- benefit analysis will have long-term negative consequences for Ronnie Jai  however  dissuades Ronnie from taking rash action In the process  is revealed that Jai and Ronnie are in the process of bribing politicians and government officials to make Ronnie the owner of a large construction project Hari later canvasses some villagers together  trying to get one of them to sign a complaint against Ronnie that can be filed with the police so that official action can be taken against Ronnie Siddhu attends the meeting at Jai 's request  but does not inform Jai or Ronnie about it immediately Instead  Siddhu offers Hari a friendly warning to cease and desist these activities During the conversation that ensues  Siddhu says that Siddhu own motto in life is simple : live and let live Hari reveals the principle guiding Hari own actions : whenever Hari sees Hari in the mirror  Hari should not feel ashamed of what Hari sees Ronnie nonetheless comes to know of the events during the meeting  and is angry Hari tells Siddhu to arrange a meeting between Hari and Hari so that Ronnie can dissuade Hari from these activities Siddhu agrees  and calls Hari over to a bridge  on the pretext that Hari Siddhu needs to talk to Hari Hari arrives at the bridge  expecting to meet Siddhu Ronnie arrives along with Ronnie men  beats up Hari  and throws Ronnie from the bridge after which Ronnie is crushed under a moving train Siddhu is furious at Jai and Ronnie  and attacks Ronnie physically  but Ronnie 's men control Ronnie  and Ronnie is allowed to go on account of the fact that Ronnie is Jai 's brother and Ronnie was the one who managed to inadvertently help Ronnie kill Hari Siddhu  returning home  can not bear the sight of Siddhu in the mirror  and breaks it It is also revealed that Hari was the brother of Alisha  something Siddhu had been unaware of because Hari was living separately Siddhu confesses everything to Fatima Madam  the female lawyer who had defended Hari in the beginning of the movie  but refuses to testify against Ronnie in court  for fear of implicating Hari elder brother Jai The lawyer tries to talk Hari into testifying  but fails She challenges Hari to reveal the truth to Alisha  which Hari does  and break up In a subsequent boxing match  that Siddhu has been preparing for several months  Siddhu is told by Siddhu brother  in the midst of the game  to throw away the match  since Ronnie has bet money on Siddhu losing Siddhu throws away the game  allowing the other boxer to beat Siddhu unconscious Siddhu is furious at Siddhu brother  and they have an oral confrontation In the process  Siddhu is forced to confront that Siddhu father had betrayed five of Siddhu friends in the Indian independence movement to the British out of fear of being tortured  causing all of them to be killed Siddhu realises that Siddhu father was a good man  but  like everybody else  was a coward and lacked the strength to fight injustice Yet  Siddhu knows that Siddhu father wanted to instill these values in Siddhu  and Siddhu vows to bring Hari 's killers to justice and complete the task that Hari attempted to begin Siddhu tells Fatime Madam that Siddhu is willing to testify publicly against Ronnie as well as against Siddhu own brother Jai  and also confesses to Fatime Siddhu theft of Rs 400 Fatime expresses pride in Siddhu  revealing that Fatime knew all along about the theft and also knew that Siddhu would reveal it to Fatime some day of Siddhu own accord Fatime tries to get Alisha to forgive Siddhu  but fails Siddhu  now a reformed man  meets up with the cricketer Siddhu had beaten up a while back  presents Siddhu with a new cricket bat  and seeks forgiveness When Ronnie discovers that Siddhu is the person who has filed a complaint against Siddhu  Siddhu is ready to kill Siddhu Jai dissuades Ronnie  reassuring Siddhu that Jai Jai will dissuade Siddhu from testifying publicly against Ronnie In an emotional scene  Siddhu  when approached by Jai  confronts Jai instead  accusing Jai of neglecting Jai duties as an elder brother by encouraging Siddhu to follow Jai in a life of crime Jai realises Jai error and apologises Upon returning home  Siddhu discovers Alisha waiting for Jai  and embrace and reconcile Later that night  Ronnie kills Jai and Jai men also try to kill Siddhu  but the motorcycle gang led by Charlie intervenes to save Siddhu 's life Siddhu wants to kill Ronnie in person to avenge Ronnie brother 's death  but the female lawyer arrives in time to dissuade Ronnie The next day  in court  Siddhu gives Siddhu testimony regarding Ronnie 's murder of Hari The court is adjourned until Monday Coming out of court  Ronnie orders for a local bandh and forces all the shops to close down He also has Siddhu 's home broken into and his belongings thrown on the street Siddhu  upon seeing this  walks up to Ronnie 's house and challenges him to come out and duel alone  rather than hiding behind henchmen Ronnie agrees  and all the people in the area come out to watch The two boxers have a long and bloody boxing match  with nobody interfering As the local people see one man with the courage to fight Raunak Singh  they awaken to the possibility that they too can resist his extortionary demands Ronnie loses the fight  but he then orders his henchmen to kill Siddhu The local people  who are much more numerous than Ronnie 's henchmen  block the attempt Together  they beat up Ronnie and Ronnie henchmen and force them to flee the area \",\n",
